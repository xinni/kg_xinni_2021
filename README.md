Assessment for Software Engineer Intern position. (Java Version)

## How to run

Code can be run in the following manner:

``` shell
java main 123 321
```

## Description

- The input arguments should be at least two. (Program will print an error message when arguments are less than two, and it will take the first two arguments when the arguments are more than 2)

- In my understanding, the two strings should have the same length. Otherwise, the program will print false.
- The program will print true when the two arguments are the empty string.
